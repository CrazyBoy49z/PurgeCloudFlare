PurgeCloudFlare
===============



##Setup Directions:

Goto System Settings and update the following:

`cf_api_key` = your CloudFlair api key, this is visible on the Account tab of CloudFlair https://www.cloudflare.com/my-account

`cf_domain`  = The domain name from your account you wish to clear example.com.au

`cf_email`   = The email address associated with the account (the one you use to log in to CloudFlair)

Once you have done this, MODX will clear your CloudFlare Cache every time the system-wide cache is cleared
